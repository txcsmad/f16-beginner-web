		<h1>Lesson 2: Objects</h1>
		<p>JavaScript objects are quite different from the objects of other languages, so let's get familiar with them. Then we can start using them to actually manipulate HTML on the page.</p>
		<p>They're a bit like HashMaps, which is to say that we don't need to list variables beforehand. We just create new ones whenever we want inside of out objects but putting a . after the object name.</p>
		<img src="https://mightybuddy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/hash1.png?w=500">
		<p><code><pre>
  //Create a new object with object literal
  var newObj={};

  //Create a new variable
  //called five inside newObj
  newObj.five=5;
	
  //Gets five out (which is 5),
  //adds 1, and puts it in newObj.six
  newObj.six=newObj.five+1;

  //Using brackets is just as good
  newObj["six"];  //returns 6
		</pre></code></p>

		<h2>Special Objects</h2>
		<p>We've actually  been using the <code>window</code> object the whole time! All variables declared with var live there, and any code not assigned to an object automatically gets assigned to it. Let's take a look:</p>
		<p><code><pre>
  var variableNamesAreHard=1024;
  window.variableNamesAreHard++;
  window["variableNamesAreHard"];
		</pre></code></p>
		<p>Just like that new object we made earlier, except this one has a lot of stuff predefined for you.</p>

		<p>Another object of significance that's defined for you is <code>document</code>. This one contains all of the HTML code of the page. We can get HTML objects in our code by using a function in the object: <code>document.getElementById</code>. We can then access and modify the text inside using the <code>innerText</code> property.</p>

		<p>Let's try it out! The next section has a lot of common HTML tags defined with <code>id</code>s. Pick one and try to change its contents.</p>
		<p>For example, since Web is the most important thing that MAD does, let's move it to the top of the list that's below, in the Testing Ground section.</p>
		<p><code><pre>
  var topOfList=document.getElementById("firstli");
  var third=document.getElementById("thirdli");
  var lessImportant=topOfList.innerText;
  topOfList.innerText=third.innerText;
  third.innerText=lessImportant;
		</pre></code></p>

		<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
		<p>We learned how to manipulate an HTML page from JavaScript code. To do that, we also learned a bit about HTML tags.</p>
